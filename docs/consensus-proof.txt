The proof of safety and liveness for Mysticeti Consensus

Brief description of scheme:
- Validators have stake that is stable throughout the epoch.
- Quorums are formed when validators with >2/3 stake support a decision.
- The protocol proceeds in rounds 0, 1, 2, 
- Each round correct validators create a single block for that round, 
  referenced as (validator, round, digest).
- A block contains an ordered list of references to previous blocks, 
  and none to current or future round blocks. We call these blocks "included".
- A block contains at least a quorum of referenced to blocks 
  from the previoud round.
- A correct block starts with a reference to the previous block from the
  creator validator.
- The system is initialized with blocks for round 0 from all 
  validators.
- A block also contains contents, which are playloads to be sequenced, 
  but otherwise play no role in the agreement protocol.

Definition of block support

A block A is supported by another (causally future) block B if A is the first 
block from the (validator, round) of A that is in the causal history of B. The
concept of "first" is defined in relation to the order of included blocks in 
the history of B, and defined recursivelly.

B supports all blocks supported in its included blocks in order. If an included 
block supports a past block that conflicts with an earlier supported block, the
earlier remains supported and the later ignored.
