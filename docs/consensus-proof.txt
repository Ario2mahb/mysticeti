The proof of safety and liveness for Mysticeti Consensus

Brief description of scheme:
- Validators have stake that is stable throughout the epoch.
- Quorums are formed when validators with >2/3 stake support a decision.
- The protocol proceeds in rounds 0, 1, 2, 
- Each round correct validators create a single block for that round, 
  referenced as (validator, round, digest).
- A block contains an ordered list of references to previous blocks, 
  and none to current or future round blocks. We call these blocks "included".
- A block contains at least a quorum of referenced to blocks 
  from the previoud round.
- A correct block starts with a reference to the previous block from the
  creator validator.
- The system is initialized with blocks for round 0 from all 
  validators.
- A block also contains contents, which are playloads to be sequenced, 
  but otherwise play no role in the agreement protocol.

Definition of block support

A block A is supported by another (causally future) block B if A is the first 
block from the (validator, round) of A that is in the causal history of B. The
concept of "first" is defined in relation to the order of included blocks in 
the history of B, and defined recursivelly.

B supports all blocks supported in its included blocks in order. For each included
block a block supports in order the blocks supported by the included block, and the 
block itself. If an included  block supports a past block that conflicts with an 
earlier supported block, the earlier remains supported and the later ignored. This
implements a depth first, right-to-left in includes, support collection.

As a result two lemmas hold:
Lemma 1. A block only supports a single block from a given (authority, round).
Lemma 2. A correct node will only ever support in any of its blocks at most a single
 (authority, round) block.
Lemma 3. Only a single block at a (val, round) will ever gather a quorum of support.

Proofs:

Lemma 1: 
By the definition of support for a block only a single (val, round) block can be
supported from a future block.  

Lemma 2: 
since a correct validator includes its last block first in any subsequent
block, the subsequent block initially supports all previously supported blocks, and 
any additional blocks included supporting conflicting blocks, will not overwrite 
this "earlier" support. Thus a validator will never change which (val, round) block
is supported once one is supported.


Lemma 3:
By quorum intersection, if two blocks A and A' with the same (val, round)
gather support, they intersect at at least one correct node. This means that the 
correct node in one block supports A and in another block support A', which by 
Lemma 2 means A = A'.

Period, Leader rounds & Decision rounds

The period (p > 1) is the number of rounds between leaders. Rounds with leaders are 
p * k (for k = 1, 2, 3, ...)  ie non-zero rounds divisible by the period. During these 
rounds a validator is deterministically chosen by all nodes to act as a leader. The 
round preceeding the leader round (ie p*(k+1) -1, for k = 1, 2, 3, 4) are called 
decision rounds, since we decide based on blocks on these rounds whether to commit 
a leader or not. We call these the leader for k and the decision round for k.

After a node passes a decision round for k (it it has a quorum of blocks for 
round p*(k+1) - 1) it checks whether there is a quorum of support for a block from 
the leader at the leader round k (ie round k*p). If so the block is committed.

When a leader at k is committed, the node goes back and check if any leaders between
the last commit and k has a quorum of support, and commits them if so. It then commits
the last leader for k.

Lemma 4: 
If a node commits a leader, the leader block will be in the history of any 
subsequent block after the decision round.

Lemma 5 (NOT TRUE NOW!)
If a node commits a leader eventually all node will commit the leader.

NOT TRUE DUE TO THE FACT THAT WE ARE NOT COUNTING POTENTIAL DOUBLE SUPPORT 
FROM BYZ NODES - SO A CORRECT NODE MAY RELY ON A BYZ VOTE TO FORM A QUORUM 
THAT OTHER NODES IGNORE, MAKING IT IMPOSIBLE TO FORM A QUORUM. NEED TO FIX
THIS IN HOW WE DEFINE SUPPORT.

Lemma 6:
At all subsequent decisions rounds if a leader has been committed in round k 
then it will have a quorum in the subsequent decisions round.

UNCLEAR IF TRUE: SO FAR WE ONLY REQUIRE THE LEADER TO HAVE A QUORUM OF SUPPORT
IN THE DECISION ROUND, BUT THIS ONLY ENSURES IT WILL BE IN THE HISTORY, NOT A 
FULL QUORUM WILL BE IN THE HISTORY. IF WE REQUIRE THAT EACH BLOCK IN THE DECISION 
ROUND HAVE A QUORUM THAT SUPPORTS THE LEADER AT K THEN THIS MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH, 
BUT MAY ALSO BE TOO STRONG TO COMMIT OFTEN.

Proofs:

Lemma 4:
A quorum at the decision round means that >2/3 by stake of blocks support the 
leader block, thus any future block needs to inlcude at least one of them to 
have sufficient stake to advance round.
